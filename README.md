# ultrasonic-parking-sensor-simple-prototype-using-buzzer
Ever wanted to create a simple simulation of the beeps that come from your car's parking sensors when you're too close to an obstacle?
This project uses the Arduino Uno microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer, to demonstrate a simple idea of how it happens.
The threshold has been set to 20 cm here, but you can modify this value as per your requirement.
Check it out!
Cheers
